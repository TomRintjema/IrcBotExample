# IrcBotExample
You know I probably should write up a tutorial or whatever for getting this stuff working
1. Make sure you have java installed (duhh)
2. Make sure you have a jdk so you can use javac
3. Make sure that you have the pircbot jar located in the same folder that the readme and all this other crap is in.
    PIRCBOT Jar : http://www.jibble.org/files/pircbot-1.5.0.zip
4. Make sure that you change the information regarding channels and whatnot so it doesn't join the one I'm testing in
5. Maybe (as of writing it's not in but) make sure that you have the authentication done in the config file setup right so the nickserv doesn't go "wait what password are you putting in this isn't right" (Also you might wanna have the nick regged that the bot is going to use otherwise that bot gonna get kicked 'cause someone's gonna steal its nick.
